Problem Statement

The Phonepe Pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.


Solution Overview

The solution includes the following steps:

    Data Extraction: Clone the Github repository through scripting and fetch the data.
    Data Transformation: Clean and pre-process the data into a suitable format.
    Database Insertion: Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database.
    Dashboard Creation: Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
    Data Retrieval: Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
    User Interaction: Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

The solution is designed to be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe Pulse Github repository.

Approach

1. Data Extraction
    Clone the Github repository using a script to fetch the data from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository. Store the data in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
2. Data Transformation
    Use Python and Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the data. This includes:
    Cleaning the data
    Handling missing values
    Transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization

3. Database Insertion
    Use the mysql-connector-python library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

4. Dashboard Creation
    Use Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
    Plotly's built-in geo map functions will be used to display the data on a map.
    Streamlit will be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

5. Data Retrieval
    Use the mysql-connector-python library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. The data in the dataframe will be used to dynamically update the dashboard.

6. Deployment
    Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.

Results
    The project will result in a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository. Key features include:
